Add an endpoint that returns a HTML page that lists a summary of most recent
news from around the world.
Do not provide arbitrary lorem ipsum values.
Do not read the contents from another file - come up with the content yourself.
Make sure the news are corresponding to actual events that did happen.
Also make sure the dates are correct and correspond to reality.

The page should include the following information
for each news item:

- Title
- Source
- URL
- Published date
- Summary

The page should be styled using CSS.
Come up with no more than 5 news items.
